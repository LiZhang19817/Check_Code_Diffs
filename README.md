## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

You need a GitHub personal access token to use this utility. You can provide it in several ways:

### For CLI:
1. Set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### For Web Interface:
- Enter your token directly in the web interface
- The token is validated in real-time and stored securely in your browser

### Creating a GitHub Token:
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token and save it securely

## Usage

### üåê Web Interface (Recommended)

Start the web interface:
```bash
python start_web.py
```

The web interface will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`

**Features:**
- **Token Management**: Validate and store your GitHub token
- **Single Branch Analysis**: Analyze commits from a specific branch
- **Branch Comparison**: Compare two branches with time filtering
- **Interactive Results**: Click commit hashes to view on GitHub
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

The CLI accepts repository names in multiple formats and supports both single branch analysis and time-filtered branch comparison:

#### Single Branch Mode (Default)

```bash
# Basic usage (defaults to 'main' branch and last 3 days)
python github_changes.py owner/repository

# Using github.com format
python github_changes.py github.com/owner/repository

# Using full URL
python github_changes.py https://github.com/owner/repository

# Specify a different branch
python github_changes.py owner/repository development

# Specify number of days to look back
python github_changes.py --days 7 owner/repository

# Limit number of commits displayed
python github_changes.py --limit 10 owner/repository
```

#### Branch Comparison Mode

Compare changes between two branches, optionally within a specific time period:

```bash
# Compare all commits between branches (uses GitHub's native comparison)
python github_changes.py --compare main..feature-branch owner/repository

# Compare branches within last 7 days (time-filtered comparison)
python github_changes.py --compare main..feature-branch --days 7 owner/repository

# Compare with custom display limit
python github_changes.py --compare main..dev --days 14 --limit 15 owner/repository

# Compare with token
python github_changes.py --token YOUR_TOKEN --compare main..feature owner/repository
```

#### Pull Request Analysis Mode

Analyze pull requests for a specific branch:

```bash
# List all pull requests for main branch
python github_changes.py --pull-requests owner/repository main

# List only open pull requests
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --pr-state open owner/repository main

# List pull requests updated in last 7 days
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --days 7 owner/repository feature-branch

# List closed pull requests with limit
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --pr-state closed --limit 10 owner/repository

# Analyze pull requests for a feature branch
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --pr-state all --days 30 owner/repository feature-auth

# Filter pull requests by Jira ID
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --jira-id PROJQUAY-9184 owner/repository main

# Combine Jira ID filter with other options
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --pr-state open --jira-id PROJQUAY-9184 --days 7 owner/repository
```

#### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Get last 3 days of changes (default)
python github_changes.py microsoft/vscode main

# Get last 7 days of changes
python github_changes.py --days 7 github.com/quay/quay master

# Get last 24 hours of changes
python github_changes.py --days 1 https://github.com/facebook/react

# Compare what changed in last week between main and development
python github_changes.py --compare main..development --days 7 quay/quay

# Compare last 3 days between feature and main branches
python github_changes.py --compare main..feature-auth --days 3 owner/repo

# Show only 5 commits per section in comparison
python github_changes.py --compare main..dev --limit 5 owner/repo

# List all PRs for main branch in last 2 weeks
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --days 14 quay/quay main

# Check open PRs for release branch
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --pr-state open owner/repo release-v2.0

# Analyze recent PR activity on feature branch
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --days 7 --limit 15 owner/repo feature-branch

# Find PRs related to specific Jira ticket
python github_changes.py --pull-requests --jira-id PROJQUAY-9184 quay/quay master
```

## Time-Filtered Branch Comparison Features

When using `--compare` with `--days`, the tool provides comprehensive analysis:

### üìä **Summary Statistics**
- **Per Branch**: Total commits, unique commits, files changed, additions/deletions
- **Comparison Overview**: Common commits and branch divergence metrics
- **Time Period**: Clear indication of the analysis timeframe

### üîç **Detailed Commit Analysis**
- **Unique to Base Branch**: Commits only in the base branch (e.g., hotfixes)
- **Unique to Compare Branch**: Commits only in the compare branch (e.g., new features)
- **Common Commits**: Shared commits between branches (e.g., merged changes)

### üé® **Enhanced Visualization**
- **Color-coded sections**: Different colors for each branch and commit type
- **Side-by-side statistics**: Easy comparison of branch metrics
- **Truncated messages**: Clean display with full information preserved
- **Commit limits**: Configurable display limits to avoid overwhelming output

## Use Cases

### üöÄ **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Daily standup: What changed yesterday?
python github_changes.py --days 1 owner/repo

# Weekly review: Compare feature branch progress
python github_changes.py --compare main..feature --days 7 owner/repo

# Sprint review: Last 14 days of development vs main
python github_changes.py --compare main..development --days 14 owner/repo
```

### üîÑ **Release Management**
```bash
# Pre-release: What's new in release branch?
python github_changes.py --compare main..release-v2.0 --days 30 owner/repo

# Hotfix analysis: What changed in production?

   - üîµ State with color coding (open/closed/draft)
   - üü° Direction (FROM branch or TO branch)
   - üìù PR title and author
   - üìÖ Last updated date
   - üí¨ Comment counts (regular + review comments)
   - üìä Files changed and code statistics

### Web Interface Output

The web interface provides:

- **Sortable, clickable commit and PR tables** with GitHub links
- **State-aware badges** for pull request status
- **Responsive design** that adapts to screen size
- **Real-time loading indicators** and error handling
- **Persistent user session** with token storage

## Development

### Running the Web Interface for Development

```bash
# Start development server
python start_web.py

# Or run Flask directly
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn:

```bash
# Install gunicorn (already in requirements.txt)
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

## Security Notes

- GitHub tokens are handled securely and never logged
- Web interface stores tokens only in browser localStorage
- All API requests require valid authentication
- CORS is configured for local development

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GitHub token is required"**: Ensure your token is set in environment variables or entered in the web interface
2. **"Repository not found"**: Check the repository name format and your token permissions
3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**: GitHub API has rate limits; wait a few minutes and try again
4. **Web interface not loading**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and port 5000 is available

### Getting Help

- Check the GitHub token has appropriate permissions (`repo` scope)
- Verify the repository name format: `owner/repository`
- Ensure the branch names exist in the repository
- For web interface issues, check browser console for errors

This enhanced tool helps teams understand:
- **Branch divergence**: How much branches have diverged over time
- **Feature progress**: What's been developed in feature branches
- **Integration planning**: What needs to be merged and when
- **Risk assessment**: Scope of changes for releases
